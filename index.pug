                        li One life; One ship.
                        li Grinding to Pirate Legend from PvP steals only .
                        li Joining a Guild IS permitted; fuck it.
                        li Emissary flags cannot be raised.
                        li No alliancing or accepting "gifted" loot.
                        li If you die or sink, the challenge is over and you must delete your pirate. Happy fuckin' birthday. You're not special.
                        li You must say happy birthday to yourself upon creating a new pirate. Every time. If you fail to do so, the run is invalid. Sorry not sorry.
                        li Each pirate must look slightly older than the last. Better start that fucker young.

                    ul 
                        li On demand PvP is permitted.
                        li If you are the reason (without a doubt) that a ship has scuttled, you may take their loot.
                        li Stealing a key counts as a steal and you may open/take the loot. This includes GH vaults.
                        li If you steal a map bundle you can turn in the loot from those digs.
                        li When encountering an enemy ship, you must beg them to tell you "happy birthday." If they wish you a happy birthday, you have the choice to run or fight. If they do not, you must kill them mercilessly.

                    ul 
                        li If you have no other boats nearby, you may server hop regularly or via tall tale portal.
                        li If there is a ship nearby, but has not engaged with you in combat, you must anchor at an outpost and log out in the tavern.
                        li If a ship is actively chasing you, you can't "dodge" them by anchoring at an outpost and logging out in the tavern. You have to beg them for birthday wishes. If they tell you happy birthday, you can dodge. If they sing you the full birthday song, including your full-length gamertag, without laughing, you get one extra life. If they do neither of these things you must run until they are out of full render distance or fight to the death.
                        li If you encounter cheaters / stream snipers (without a doubt), whose sole purpose is to end your run, you may leave the server. Here's hoping DGE hasn't listed your ass.

                    ul 
                        li You can't turn in flags or log books you find randomly.
                        li You may buy a captained ship (and even add it to your guild!).
                        li If crew(s) are stacking the Fort of the Damned and they have loot stacked on the barrel inside of the vault, you may complete the event and take ONLY the stacked loot, but not the current / active loot.
                        li You can't kill, or assist in killing any boss that would result in finishing an event. This includes Skeleton Fleet ships, Ghost ships, Ashen Lords, Graymarrow, etc.
                        li You can sink skeleton or ghost ships to gain supplies.
                        li You can defend yourself against PvE waves if needed. For example, Flameheart event or if skeleton ships are chasing you.
                        li You cannot kill megolodons or krakens, but must escape because I'm feeling like a bitter bastard and want some shitty arbitrary rules in play.
